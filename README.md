### Commands

Enter the terminal/shell commands to associate with the quick toggle on/off actions.

Tips:
- Run multiple commands by using `&` between commands.
- Chain multiple commands together to run one at a time using `&&` between commands.
- By default, commands do not run in a terminal window and will not show any output or error messages. Test the full command first by running it in the terminal before adding it to the extension to verify it is correct. 
- To run a command in a terminal window, use `gnome-terminal -- command`. Note that by default the GNOME terminal will close after the command is complete, but that can be changed in the terminal preferences if needed.
- Sudo commands require a password input from the terminal, so they will not directly work by themselves since commands run without a terminal window by default. However, you can use `gnome-terminal -- command` to run the command in the terminal. For example, `gnome-terminal -- sudo apt-get update` will open a terminal, prompt for your password, and then run the command.

### Appearance

Enter the text and icon information to use for the quick toggle button.

For a list of available symbolic icons to use refer to:
[GNOME default icons](https://github.com/StorageB/icons/blob/main/GNOME46Adwaita/icons.md) or
[Ubuntu Yaru icons](https://github.com/StorageB/icons/blob/main/Yaru/icons.md)

Alternatively, navigate to the icon directory for your systemâ€™s theme (located at /usr/share/icons), or use the [Icon Library app](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.design.IconLibrary).

Enter the name of the icon without the file extension. Note that icon appearance will vary depending on your systems's theme.

### Startup Behavior

Specify the state of the toggle button at startup (on, off, or to remember the previous state it was in), and select if you want that command to run at startup.

If Run Command at Startup is selected, there is an option to specify a delay time before the command is executed. Because GNOME extensions load early in the startup process, it may be required to delay your command from running by a few seconds to allow other processes to finish loading first. If this is not required, set the delay to 0.
