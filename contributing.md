## Translations

To create a new translation:
1. Create a new `.po` file for your language from the template `po/custom-command-toggle.pot`, or request one by opening an issue. 
2. Translate the strings in the `.po` file.
3. Create a pull request to add the translated `.po` file to the `/po` directory. Compiled `.mo` files will be automatically generated during release and do not need to be submitted. 


Translation notes:
- Do not translate or remove the following placeholders: `%s, %d, \n`
